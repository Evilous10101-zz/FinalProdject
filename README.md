EULA
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a basic EULA to state that you got a license to use this software and That Michael Richard Lannon owns it.



This can be used for whatever reason you want. Just don't sell any data or accounts 
You can edit it as much as you want. 


If you cannot follow up with this then nothing will happen since I won't know. I am using a throwaway Google account with a mega.nz account for this project
