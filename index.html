<p> This is a basic EULA to state that you got a license to use this software and That Michael Richard Lannon owns it.

<br>
<br> This can be used for whatever reason you want. Just don't sell any data or accounts
<br> You can edit it as much as you want. 
 <br> 
<br>
 <br>If you cannot follow up with this then nothing will happen since I won't know. I am using a throwaway Google account with a mega.nz account for this project
